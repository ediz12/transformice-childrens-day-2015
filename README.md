# transformice-childrens-day-2015
A new mini game event in Transformice about Turkish Children's Day in 2015.

Fan-made live video from 2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FDsVTL51pY

# THE IDEA
The general event will take inside a school and the mice's purpose will be decorate the classrooms and the school overall.
There will be a teachers department room and in there, there will be a box that the mice will take one piece of something,
And there will be a teacher sitting on his chair, telling the mouse where to put that thing,
And the mouse will go to the desired place and put it there, and will gain a "point"
When everything is put in the places, there will be a kind of celebration afterwards.


This is how the school roughly would look like in draft: http://prntscr.com/6mkyxp Integrated to TFMs gameplay of course
